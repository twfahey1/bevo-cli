# Bevo CLI

## About
This is a command line tool for ITS WCS developers!

## Getting started

### `bevo init`
This command will prompt you for a GitHub access token to perform various actions on your behalf. The command should provide a link to generate a token. The token should be given as broad as permissions as possible. It is then saved locally for reference.

### `bevo utdk-init`
This command will setup a fully function UTDK environment.
